# r2cytoscape 
Functions for Cytoscape Automation in R

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cytoscape/r2cytoscape.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cytoscape/r2cytoscape)

For a quick start, see [check-cytoscape-connection.R](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/blob/master/for-scripters/R/check-cytoscape-connection.R). This example creates a network from a list of nodes and edges, and then maps node and edge attribute data to various visual properties.

## Developers
You can edit or add new functions to the r2cytoscape package by making pull requests to this repository. Here are some helpful notes to keep in mind:
* Do not edit the man/\*.Rd files or NAMESPACE file directly. They are automatically generated by [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html). Simply edit the R/\*.R files to supply documentation annotations.
* To rebuild the documentation after making edits to the .R files, run ```devtools::document()``` or in RStudio, open the r2cytoscape project (upper right toolbar) and then use the Build menu options.
* Provide ```base.url='http://localhost:1234/v1'``` as an optional arg at the end.
* Provide ```network='current'``` and ```network.viewid='current'``` as optional args towards the end, if needed. And then make use of *getNetworkSuid()*, *getNetworkName()* and *getNetworkViewId()* accordingly to retrieve IDs (or names) for current network and view.
* As always, position required args before options args to allow efficient function calls
* **Testing**: you can run ```devtools::test()``` at any time. Make sure you have Cytoscape running, otherwise the tests will be skipped! 
* Run ```devtools::check()``` at the end of your development, prior to making any pull requests.
* Refer to [the issues](../../issues) for functions to be developed to help prioritize your work and choose harmonous function names and args. Thanks!
