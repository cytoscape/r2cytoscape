# r2cytoscape 
Suite of wrappers for CyREST functions in R

For a quick start, see [check-cytoscape-connection.R](../check-cytoscape-connection.R). This example creates a network from a list of nodes and edges, and then maps node and edge attribute data to various visual properties.

#### How to see a list of:
* Visual properties for node/edge/network changes: http://localhost:1234/v1/styles/visualproperties/
* Available network layouts: http://localhost:1234/v1/apply/layouts/
* Params associated with a layout: http://localhost:1234/v1/apply/layouts/kamada-kawai


## Developers
You can edit or add new functions to the r2cytoscape package by making pull requests to this repository. Here are some helpful notes to keep in mind:
* Do not edit the man/\*.Rd files or NAMESPACE file directly. They are automatically generated by [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html). Simply edit the R/\*.R files to supply documentation annotations.
* To rebuild the documentation after making edits to the .R files, run devtools::document() or in RStudio, open the r2cytoscape project (upper right toolbar) and then use the Build menu options.
* Provide *base.url='http://<span></span>localhost:1234/v1'* as an optional arg towards the end, if needed.
* Provide *network='current'* and *network.viewid='current'* as optional args towards the end, if needed. And then make use of *getNetworkSuid()*, *getNetworkName()* and *getNetworkViewId()* accordingly to retrieve IDs (or names) for current network and view.
* As always, position required args before options args to allow efficient function calls
* Refer to the roadmap of functions to be developed to help prioritize your work and choose harmonous function names and args. Thanks!
